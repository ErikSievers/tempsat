# Satellite Development Settings

This feature sets up all things we need to do for Satellite Development, mainly it contains the configuration to export default content.
Since the default content is provided through xml files it would be good if there was a nice version to easily export created content into xml.

The main git branch for this feature is 7.x-1.x like any versioned drupal module should.

Please keep all other enhancements in the same fashion.
